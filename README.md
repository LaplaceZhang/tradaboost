Transfer Learning
=====
See the original code for TrAdaBoost at [chenchiwei's work](https://github.com/chenchiwei/tradaboost)

Here we use this transfer learning algorithm for intrusion detection purpose, the dataset can find at [CIC IDS-2017](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html).

Compare with another transfer learning algorithm TCA(transfer component analysis), originaly is from [Jindong Wang's work](https://github.com/jindongwang/transferlearning), we use this for IDS purpose as well.
